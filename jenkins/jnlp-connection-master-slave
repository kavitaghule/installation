1} Set Up SSH or JNLP Connections:

Jenkins agents can be connected to the master using different protocols, such as -SSH or -JNLP (Java Web Start).
SSH is a secure option for connecting agents, while JNLP is more straightforward. You can choose the method 
that best suits your security and convenience needs.

go to /jenkins-url/jenkins/computer
built in node= controller
have to create nodes 
crete node1/permenant agent/ok//name/label/no of executer=2/3/4/
remote dir=/opt/project-1          // folde must be in linux
label =dev /qa /test
usage= use this node as much as possible
lauch method= lauch agent via controller 
,via ssh, via execution cmd on controller
save
prerequisits on node1=
java installed
run cmds given on node/ jenkins
run cmd on node/ec2
{nohup url & }= always have to run node1 online



for ssh 
lauch method= launch via ssh
select host = private ip on server
select credential = sshusername with privatekey
ssh-keygen on cli paste private key id.rsa in credentials
relaunch agent but still it is not connected
copy /root/ssh/id.rsa.pub to /root/ssh/authorized-key at the end 


use lable in job build run job on particular node
